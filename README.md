# Design and Prototype of a Multi-Objective Environment Sensing Capability ESC System for Shared With Rotating Radars
## Summary 
Recent recommendations by regulatory bodies to use a distributed network of spectrum sensing/measurement devices, called environmental sensing capability (ESC) devices, which facilitates shared access (SA) between wireless communications and rotating radar systems has generated considerable research interest. We demonstrate a prototype of a multi-objective ESC system that facilitates a spectrum access system (SAS) to enable SA with ground-based fixed rotating radars. The implemented ESC device 1) detects radar signals; 2) measures interference from secondary users (Sus) for radar protection; and 3) also measures SUsâ€™ airtime utilization (ATU) in a channel. The proposed ESC assisted SAS architecture can help in reducing the size of currently proposed large exclusion zones around the rotating radar systems. The prototype of the proposed ESC is implemented on Wireless Open Access Research Platform (WARP) nodes with Xilinx Field-programmable gate array (FPGAs).
